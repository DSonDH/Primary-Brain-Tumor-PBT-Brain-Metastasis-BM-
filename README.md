# Primary Brain Tumor (PBT) and Brain Metastasis (BM)
1. BRATS2015 training with SNUH(Seoul National University Hospital) brain tumor data segmentation test

2. segment PBT and BM of SNUH data. Then define the feature vector and using the feature vector, classify the PBT and BM

3. We extracted feature using the deep learning segmentation network, U-net

4. Using various classifier, we could discriminate PBT and BM roughly (accuracy 85%)
